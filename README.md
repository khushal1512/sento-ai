## About

Sento AI is an intelligent social media automation platform that empowers creators and businesses to manage their online presence effortlessly. Using AI agents, Sento generates engaging content, creates reels, and posts directly to Instagram and Facebook — all from a simple text prompt.

## The Problem

Small and medium businesses (MSMEs) often lack access to expensive marketing teams and professional social media expertise. Creating consistent, high-quality content across multiple platforms is time-consuming and requires skills that many entrepreneurs simply don't have. 

**Sento AI bridges this gap** by providing an AI-powered solution that automates content creation and publishing, allowing business owners to focus on what they do best — running their business.

3. **Generates** a video using Google Veo 3.1
4. **Adds** background audio to make the reel engaging
5. **Creates** a catchy caption with relevant hashtags
6. **Uploads** the video to ImageKit for hosting
7. **Publishes** directly to Instagram as a Reel
